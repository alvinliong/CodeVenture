Welcome to Code Venture!

Several features are still under development and not working yet. We were not able to
complete them due to time. Some buttons will be disabled as their features are not
fully usable and hence disabled for this production version.

The content for the Python course was taken from the following webiste:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-python-guide-for-beginners/

Usernames and passwords will be available in the users.json file in the /data folder.

Currently, only student accounts can be used and created.

The features that were in production but were not completed can be found in the /unused folder.



To start the application, run the MainFrame.py file.
